Facing tactical advantages in air support, armored vehicles, and experience, the Japanese forces forced the Allies into retreat. The destruction of key bridges hindered British mobility, while Japanese divisions landed on both the east and west coasts. The sinking of Force Z by Japanese air power weakened naval defenses, allowing for further Japanese advancement along the west coast. The British delay in executing planned operations in southern Thailand and the loss of naval assets marked significant setbacks, paving the way for Japanese control over Malaya during World War II."
